# Contributing Guide
Thank you for taking the time to contribute :tada:

## Creating Pull Requests
> Before making bigger changes, please discuss them in an issue.

In general PRs should be kept as small as possible (e.g. one feature/fix per PR). It allows merging them faster with less conflicts and will reduce review time.

### Repository Setup
- Create a fork of this repo and clone it
- Run `npm install` inside the cloned directory
- Create a new working branch for your changes
